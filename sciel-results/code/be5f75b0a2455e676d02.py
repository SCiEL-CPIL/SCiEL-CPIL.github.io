    # We check if T_reconstructed matches the target.
    
    # The target tensor is sparse.
    # For each c, it adds a rank-1 tensor.
    # We just need to ensure that for all i,j,k, the sum is 1 if it's a "valid" multiplication term in the tensor definition.
    # The tensor definition for matrix multiplication has 1s at (i,j), (j,k), (i,k) in the respective spaces.
    # Here W index is k*n+i.
    
    # Check one specific term: i=0, j=0, k=0
    # u=0, v=0, w=0
    # U[0, c] V[0, c] W[0, c]
    # In schoolbook, only c=0 has 1s at these positions for i=0,j=0,k=0.
    # So sum is 1.
    
    # Check a non-term: i=0, j=0, k=1 (assuming p>1)
    # u=0, v=1, w=1*n+0 = 2 (if n=2)
    # In schoolbook, c for (0,0,1) is c=1 (if order i,j,k loops 0,0,1).
    # U[0, 1]=1, V[1, 1]=1, W[2, 1]=1.
    # But we are summing over c.
    # For c=0: U[0,0]=1, V[1,0]=0 (V[0,0]=1 is for j=0,k=0). So term is 0.
    # For c=1: U[0,1]=0 (U[0,1] is for j=0? No, U[i*m+j]. For i=0,j=0, u=0. U[0,1] is 0 in schoolbook because c=1 is for k=1, which uses U[0,1]?
    # Wait, in schoolbook:
    # c iterates over (i,j,k).
    # U[i*m+j, c] = 1 if c corresponds to (i,j,k_current).
    # So U[u, c] is 1 only if c's i,j match u's i,j.
    # V[v, c] is 1 only if c's j,k match v's j,k.
    # W[w, c] is 1 only if c's k,i match w's k,i.
    # So U[u,c]V[v,c]W[w,c] is non-zero only if:
    # c's (i,j) == u's (i,j)
    # c's (j,k) == v's (j,k)
    # c's (k,i) == w's (k,i)
    # This implies c's (i,j,k) == (i,j,k) derived from u,v,w.
    # If such a c exists in the set of all (i,j,k), then the product is 1.
    # The set of all c is exactly all (i,j,k).
    # So the sum is 1 if (i,j,k) is a valid index, which it always is for i in n, j in m, k in p.
    # And the target tensor T has 1s at all valid (i,j,k) combinations?
    # Yes, the multiplication tensor has 1s for all $i,j,k$.
    # So the reconstruction is exact.
