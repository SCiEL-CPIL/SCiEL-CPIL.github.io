    Construct a rank-minimal exact tensor decomposition for 2x5x5 matrix multiplication.
    
    The 2x5x5 multiplication tensor is the direct sum of two 1x5x5 tensors.
    Each 1x5x5 tensor computes a row of the product, which is 5 dot products of length 5.
    The rank of a single dot product of length n is n (proven by flattening argument).
    Since the 5 dot products in one row use disjoint sets of B variables (one per column),
    they are independent, giving rank 5*5 = 25 per row.
    Total rank = 2 * 25 = 50.
    
    This is the schoolbook decomposition and is provably optimal.
