    # T[i,j,k] = 1 for all valid (i,j,k) since every triple contributes.
    # But that gives rank 1 which is absurd.

    # j indexes cols of A / rows of B, k indexes cols of C/B.
    # C[i,k] = sum_j T[i,j,k] A[i,j] B[j,k]

    # I think the issue is that the tensor should be T[i,j,k] = delta_{j,j} which is 1,
    # but the "structure" comes from how i,j,k are linked.
    #
    # Actually, I think the correct tensor is: for each (i,k), C[i,k] = sum_j A[i,j]B[j,k]
