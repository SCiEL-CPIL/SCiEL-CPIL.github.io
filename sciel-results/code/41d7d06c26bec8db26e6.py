    # Instead, we use: for each subset S, count triples where triple_mask & ~S == 0
    # i.e., triple_mask is a subset of S.
    # 
    # Efficient approach: for each triple with mask m (m is 3 bits), it contributes
    # to all subsets S that contain m. So we can do a zeta transform.

    # Actually simpler: just iterate all subsets and all triples. 2^18 * 816 ~ 214M - too slow.

    # triples with that exact mask have index <= max_idx. Then for each S, sum over all
    # 3-bit submasks of S.
    # 
    # Even better: use inclusion or just iterate. 2^18 subsets, for each we need to sum
    # over 3-bit submasks. Number of 3-bit submasks of an 18-bit set of size k is C(k,3).
    # Average over all subsets: sum_{k=0}^{18} C(18,k) * C(k,3) / 2^18.
    # This equals C(18,3) * 2^(18-3) / 2^18 = 816/32 = 25.5. So total ~ 2^18 * 25.5 ~ 6.7M. OK.

    # exactly 3 vertices, so a triple fully contained in a 3-set S means the triple IS S).
    # ceil(3/3) = 1. So each 3-subset that forms a triple must have that triple available.

    # For any subset S of vertices, the number of triples fully contained in S must be
    # at least ceil(|S|/3). This is necessary because each triple in the matching that
    # intersects S uses at least 1 vertex of S, and a triple fully in S "covers" 3 vertices.
    # Actually this isn't quite right either.
    #
    # Let me just do the size-1 check (each vertex in >= 1 triple) and size-6 check
    # (any 6-set must have >= 2 triples fully in it, since ceil(6/3)=2).
    # The size-6 check: C(18,6) = 18564 subsets. For each, count triples fully in it.
    # That's 18564 * 816 ~ 15M. Might be OK.
    
    # Actually, let me just do the vertex-level check and a few more.
    # The main benefit is catching obviously infeasible prefixes early.
    
    # Size-2: each pair of vertices must be in at least 1 available triple together? No,
    # ceil(2/3)=1 means we need 1 triple fully in the 2-set, which is impossible (triples
    # have 3 vertices). So the condition is vacuous for |S| < 3.
    
    # For |S| = 3: need >= 1 triple fully in S. Only possible if S is exactly a triple.

    # For |S| = 6: need >= 2 triples fully in S.
    
    # Let's check |S| = 3: for each 3-subset that is a triple in the list, it must be available.
    # This is already implied by the vertex check mostly.
    
    # For efficiency, let's just check: for each vertex, count >= 1 (done above),
    # and for the full set, total triples >= 6.
