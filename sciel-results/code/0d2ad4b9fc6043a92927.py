    Find a rank-minimal exact tensor decomposition for multiplying a 2x4 matrix by a 4x5 matrix.

    # The theoretical lower bound for 2x4x5 is at least 2*5=10 (output size)
    # and at least max(2*4, 4*5)=20 in some sense, but tensor rank can be lower.
    # Schoolbook: 2*4*5 = 40
    # Current: 36

    # 2x2x5 matrix multiply: rank is at most 2*2*5=20 schoolbook, 
    # but can we do better?
    # Actually, for 2x2xp, the rank is known to be 2p for p>=2 (no improvement over schoolbook)
    # So that doesn't help.
    
    # Alternative: think of it as computing C[i,k] = sum_j A[i,j]*B[j,k]
    # For fixed i,k, this is a dot product of length 4.
    
    # Let me try: split the j-dimension into two halves of size 2.
    # C = A_left * B_left + A_right * B_right
    # where A_left is 2x2, A_right is 2x2, etc.
    # Each 2x2x5 multiply: can we do this in less than 7*? 
    # No, 2x2xp requires at least 2p multiplications in general.
    
    # What about using the fact that we only have 2 rows?
    # C[0,k] = A[0,0]*B[0,k] + A[0,1]*B[1,k] + A[0,2]*B[2,k] + A[0,3]*B[3,k]
