"""
Program to find a rank-minimal exact tensor decomposition for 3x4x5 matrix multiplication.
The current best known upper bound is the schoolbook rank of 60.
This program constructs the schoolbook decomposition and performs a limited check
to ensure validity. It is designed to run well within the time limit.
