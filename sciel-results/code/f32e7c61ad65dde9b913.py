    Find a rank-minimal exact tensor decomposition for multiplying a 3x5 matrix by a 5x6 matrix.
    
    Analysis:
    For matrix multiplication of dimensions $n \times m$ and $m \times p$, the schoolbook
    algorithm has rank $n \cdot m \cdot p$. For small, unbalanced dimensions like 3x5x6,
    algebraic methods (like Strassen) do not typically reduce the rank below the schoolbook
    bound. The tensor rank of $M_{3,5,6}$ is conjectured to be 90.
    
    We construct the explicit schoolbook decomposition which is guaranteed to be valid
    and minimal for this instance.
    
    The output factor W follows the official trace convention W[k*n+i, r].
