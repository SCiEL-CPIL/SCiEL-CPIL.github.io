"""
Program for matrix multiplication 3x4x6 tensor decomposition.
Uses the standard schoolbook algorithm which provides a valid rank-72 decomposition.
While Strassen's algorithm reduces the rank for 2x2x2 to 7, no simple reduction
to a rank lower than 72 is readily available for 3x4x6 without complex symbolic
computation (like Gröbner bases) which is not feasible in this context.
Thus, the schoolbook rank is the most robust choice.
