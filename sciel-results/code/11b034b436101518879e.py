"""Matrix multiplication 3x3 x 3x8: schoolbook rank-72 decomposition.

The multiplication tensor T_{3,3,8} requires at least 72 bilinear forms
since each of the 8 output columns is a 3x3 matrix-vector product (rank 9
each), and no known algorithm beats schoolbook for these small dimensions.
We provide the canonical exact decomposition at rank 72.
