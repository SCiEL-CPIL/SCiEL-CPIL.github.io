"""Stronger search for rank-minimal tensor decomposition of 2x3 * 3x8 matrix multiplication.

Strategy:
  1. Start with a structured base: Strassen for the (2,2,2) sub-block plus schoolbook for the
     remaining row/column, giving rank 44 (current best known here).
  2. Attempt to reduce the rank by finding linear dependencies among the 44 term vectors in the
     tensor space.  We search for a subset of columns whose span contains the required tensor
     using a greedy randomized approach combined with integer/half-integer rounding.
  3. Validate any candidate with exact rational arithmetic.
  4. If no improvement is found within the time budget, return the known rank-44 decomposition.
