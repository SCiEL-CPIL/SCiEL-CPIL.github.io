"""
Program for rank-minimal exact tensor decomposition of 3x3 * 3x4 matrix multiplication.
Uses integer linear programming and structured search to find minimal rank.

Strategy:
- Model the tensor decomposition as a system of equations
- Use ILP with discrete values to find minimal rank decompositions
- Leverage the 3x3x4 geometry for potential sharing patterns
